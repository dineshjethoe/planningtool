KLM technical test (assignment)

Instructions to build and configure:
1. Open the solution file (.sln) in VS and build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
2. Right click on the Database project (named 'Database') and select Publish. Publish/deploy the database to a default local SQL server instance (no express edition, otherwise the connection string must be edited in the .config files of WinApp and Repositories).The database name would be KlmPlanningToolDb. Or use the profile file 'https://github.com/dineshjethoe/planningtool/blob/master/Database/Database.publish.xml' for the database deployment. 
3. Run the application, add a task and an employee and then make an assignment. There will be six icons (buttons) on the menu, (from left to right) Tasks, Employees, Assignments, Add, Edit and Remove.
